## About

This is a memory game that I developed for [The Odin Project: Javascript module, React project: Memory Card](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card). The purpose of this was to practice using React, specifically using hooks or lifecycle methods, and state. I chose functional components and therefore hooks.

### Live Demo

## Roadmap

* Add different levels (number of cards) - level progresses as user completes one
* Update CSS - at the moment it is a pretty basic interface
* Add loading screen, and 'user journey'
* Add flip-card effect

### Known Issues

* To check mobile responsiveness
* CSS requires lots of 'importants' - to check why
